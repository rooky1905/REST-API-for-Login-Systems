# REST-API-for-Login-Systems
This is a REST API service made with Django Rest Framework for a Login system.

For this project I created a Vagrant server which allows me to create a 'Local Development Server'.
This Vagrant file is ran on Virtual Box which gives us the Virtual server on which our Application code is ran.

Few steps to get the project going;
1. Open cmd in the folder
2. Type 'vagrant up'
3. Type 'vagrant ssh'
4. Type 'cd /vagrant'
5. Type 'source ~/env/bin/activate' (because I have used a virtual env inside the virual server)
6. Type 'python manage.py runserver'
